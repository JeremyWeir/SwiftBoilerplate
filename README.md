# SwiftBoilerplate
This is a basic Xcode starter project. The app contains no functionality besides an iOS 8 app that saves a value to NSUserDefaults and then displays that value in a WatchKit App, a WatchKit Glance, and a Today Extension.

It simply uses a shared framework class and NSUserDefaults with an app group.

To see the Today extension, run the simulator with the main iOS app target selected.

To see the WatchKit app and glance, you have to make sure the simulator has a watch external display enabled. To see the WatchKit App or Watchkit Glance in action, select their respective targets in the scheme selector when running the app.
